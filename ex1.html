    <h2>What Are Horcruxes?</h2>
    <div class="c3">
    <p>
        Simply put, a Horcrux is a piece of one’s soul. 
        If a witch or wizard creates a Horcrux, then they can never truly die until said Horcrux is destroyed as well.
         A person’s physical body can be destroyed, but their soul can live on.
          So, when Voldemort’s killing curse backfired after attempting to murder young Harry, his physical body was destroyed. 
          However, since Voldemort had numerous other Horcruxes, he was not truly dead.
